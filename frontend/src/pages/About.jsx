                        At ReWeb, we believe there is a better way to experience programming. So, we created an innovative platform that aims to make programming easier, more efficient, and more fun for programmers of all levels of experience. We understand that coding can be a challenging task, especially for beginners, and we wanted to create a tool that can help them learn and grow.

                        <p>
                            To create ReWeb, we used a combination of Flask and React to build a web application that is both user-friendly and efficient. Flask is a lightweight web framework that allowed us to quickly develop the backend of our project. Meanwhile, React is a popular front-end library that enabled us to create a responsive and interactive user interface. In addition to Flask and React, we integrated OpenAI as the overall model for our project in order to provide accurate and helpful feedback to programmers, helping them to learn and improve their coding skills. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, ReWeb has something to offer.
